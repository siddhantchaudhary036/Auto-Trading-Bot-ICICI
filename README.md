In my anecdotal opinion this bot is capable of achieving higher than market returns in both bear and bull markets as it can take both long & short positions. The bot trades equities intraday using MIS. It is more profitable if you purchase the 0 brokerage plan at Kotak since this bot is pretty brokerage heavy due to the number of orders it executes. 

To setup the bot first enter your credentials in the keys.py file. Make sure you meet all the requirements for the program. Then Clone this github repo and just run the main_manual.py file. Make sure to change the intial_funds and amount_per_trade constants to your liking. This will decide how much quantity the bot trades with. Please dont take any unjustified speculative risks. 

Have fun! If you have any problems or need help reach out!
